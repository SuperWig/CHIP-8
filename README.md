# Dan's CHIP-8 Emulator

Nothing particularly special. Uses Raylib for graphics.

# Building:

Dependencies:
* [argparse][]
* [fmtlib][]
* [raylib][]

[argparse] and [fmtlib] aren't exactly _needed_ dependencies, I'm just lazy and also wanted coloured output for one lone error message ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

You can use the CMake option `USE_FALLBACK` to download and build these dependencies from source if you don't have them installed. Example:
```cmake
cmake -B build -DUSE_FALLBACK=ON
cmake --build build
```

There may have been more, I just can't remember them. Those were the primary sources, however.
